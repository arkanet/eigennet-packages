# - The list of libraries cached in /etc/ld.so.cache
# - /lib, followed by /usr/lib
#
# the examples in this list are for linux, so check if the plugin is

    # When multiple links exist between hosts
    # the weight of interface is used to determine
    # the link to use. Normally the weight is
    # automatically calculated by olsrd based
    # on the characteristics of the interface,
    # but here you can specify a fixed value.
    # Olsrd will choose links with the lowest value.
    # Note:
    # Interface weight is used only when LinkQualityLevel is set to 0.
    # For any other value of LinkQualityLevel, the interface ETX
    # value is used instead.

    # If a certain route should be preferred 
    # or ignored by the mesh, the Link Quality 
    # value of a node can be multiplied with a factor 
    # entered here. In the example the route 
    # using 192.168.0.1 would rather be ignored.
    # A multiplier of 0.5 will result in a small
    # (bad) LinkQuality value and a high (bad)
    # ETX value.
    # Note:
    # Link quality multiplier is used only when
    # LinkQualityLevel is > 0.
